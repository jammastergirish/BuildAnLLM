"What is Python?","Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than languages like C++ or Java."
"Explain recursion","Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It consists of two parts: a base case (the stopping condition) and a recursive case (where the function calls itself with a smaller or simpler input). Recursion is useful for problems that can be broken down into similar subproblems."
"What is a transformer?","A transformer is a deep learning architecture introduced in the paper 'Attention Is All You Need' in 2017. It relies entirely on attention mechanisms to process sequences, eliminating the need for recurrent or convolutional layers. Transformers have become the foundation for modern language models like GPT, BERT, and LLaMA."
"How does attention work?","Attention allows a model to focus on different parts of the input when processing each element. In self-attention, each token in a sequence can attend to all other tokens, learning relationships and dependencies. The attention mechanism computes a weighted sum of values, where the weights are determined by how relevant each token is to the current one."
"What is machine learning?","Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following predefined rules, ML algorithms identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns. Common types include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning."
"Explain gradient descent","Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a loss function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent (negative gradient). It's fundamental to training neural networks. The algorithm updates parameters by taking small steps proportional to the gradient of the loss function with respect to those parameters."
"What is backpropagation?","Backpropagation is the algorithm used to train neural networks. It calculates gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight by propagating errors backward through the network. The name comes from the fact that gradients flow backward from the output layer to the input layer, opposite to the forward pass of data."
"What is a neural network?","A neural network is a computing system inspired by biological neural networks. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Each connection has a weight, and neurons apply an activation function to their weighted inputs. Neural networks learn by adjusting these weights through training on data."
"What is overfitting?","Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and irrelevant patterns, which hurts its ability to generalize to new, unseen data. Signs include very low training error but high validation error. Common solutions include regularization, dropout, early stopping, and using more training data."
"What is regularization?","Regularization is a technique to prevent overfitting by adding constraints or penalties to the model. Common methods include L1 regularization (Lasso), which adds the sum of absolute weights, and L2 regularization (Ridge), which adds the sum of squared weights. These penalties encourage the model to use simpler, smaller weights."
